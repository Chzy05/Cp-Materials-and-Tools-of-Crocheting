<p><i>Crocheting can require various types of tools and equipment that can improve the quality of our work. As a beginner we will only focus </i></p>
<p><i>on the most essential basic crochet materials which consist of the Yarn, Crochet hooks, Scissors, Tapestry needle, and Stitch Markers.</i></p>
<br>
<h3>1. Yarn </h3>

<p><i>This is the material we'll be crocheting with. This will  depend on the person's project, it has </i></p>
<p><i> different colours and types such as wool or cotton that can add to create diverse textures to their</i></p>
<p><i>creations.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>2. Crochet Hooks</h3>

<p><i>This is the tool that we'll need to loop the yarn. This come's in various sizes and materials</i></p>
<p><i> like metal or wood which can add different textures and feeling in our hand while crocheting.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>3. Scissors</h3>

<p><i>This will be used to cut and lessen the risk of ruining the yarns' quality.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>4. Tapestry Needle</h3>

<p><i>Helps to weave the loose ends. A tapestry needle is a blunt needle with a large eye. The large</i></p>
<p><i> eye is useful to needleworkers because it can accommodate threads or fibres that are thicker than</i></p>
<p><i>ordinary sewing thread. Most tapestry needles are large enough to accommodate crochet thread </i></p>
<p><i>or embroidery floss, and many are large enough to accommodate yarn as well.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>5. Stitch markers</h3>

<p><i>Stitch markers can help to track your progress. It is a small tool that helps your track of</i></p>
<p><i> what round, row or stitch you're on in your crochet project.</i></p>
